1. Scikit-learn's CountVectorizer is used to convert a collection of text documents to a vector of term/token counts.

2. It enables the â€‹pre-processing of text data prior to generating the vector representation. 

3. This functionality makes it a highly flexible feature representation module for text.

4. CountVectorizer tokenizes(tokenization means breaking down a sentence or paragraph or any text into words) 
the text along with performing very basic preprocessing like removing the punctuation marks, converting all the words to lowercase, etc.

5. CountVectorizer provides a simple way to both tokenize a collection of text documents and build a vocabulary of known words, 
but also to encode new documents using that vocabulary.

6. You can use it as follows: Create an instance of the CountVectorizer class.
